Characters Viewer

I started making the core app from a template that android studio has already embedded (master/detail flow). It has all the core structure that I need to start working on the app as well as the guidelines with material design.
Then I decided to generate POJOs with a converter and then use Retrofit and a GSON converter to get RESTful services the fastest way that I can. Itâ€™s very simple to use and the most used framework for that.
I used flavors to make different calls for different APIs
For rendering images, I used Glide. I decided to use it because it renders images in a better way and use less memory than Picasso.
